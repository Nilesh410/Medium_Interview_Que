Que:- How does JavaScript’s event delegation work?
Answer: Event delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a parent element to manage 
events for its child elements. This improves performance and simplifies event handling.
// Select the parent element
const itemList = document.getElementById('item-list');

// Attach a single event listener to the parent
itemList.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    // Check if a list item was clicked
    if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
        alert('Item clicked: ' + event.target.textContent);
    }
});
Only one listener is attached to the ul, even if more li elements are added later.

Que:- Explain closures and how they can be used in JavaScript.
Answer: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references
 to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, 
closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Que:- 4. What are JavaScript Promises, and how do they differ from callbacks?
Answer: Promises represent asynchronous operations and provide a cleaner, 
more manageable way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks, which can lead to “callback hell.”
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback('Data received');
    }, 1000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
    console.log(data); // Output: Data received
});
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Data received');
        }, 1000);
    });
}

fetchData().then((data) => {
    console.log(data); // Output: Data received
});

Que-5. What is the this keyword, and how does its value change in different contexts?
Answer: The this keyword refers to the context in which a function is called. 
Its value changes depending on how the function is invoked, such as in global scope, 
object methods, or event handlers.
